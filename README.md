# TTV-ClipShoutOut
TTV Browser Source to display Clips from Streamers who get Shout Outs.
This requires a Twitch Dev Account and an Application setup to get an ApplicationId and It's Secert to do Application oAuth.
Once you set that up replace the values in the appropriate location in the code.
Currently it will launch on a !so and !bl command from Broadcaster and mods. Feel free to modify as your channel requires.
